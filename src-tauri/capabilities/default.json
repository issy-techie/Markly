Broad fs:scope and opener:allow-open-path scopes ('**') are intentional: Markly is a general-purpose Markdown editor that must read/write files in any user-chosen project directory. Restricting scopes would break core functionality (opening arbitrary folders, saving files, managing .assets directories). All file operations are gated by explicit user actions (folder picker, save dialog, context menu). See CSP in tauri.conf.json for network/script restrictions.",
